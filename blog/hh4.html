            <div class="blog-meta">August 29th, 2024</div>
            <p>Moved in yesterday. I'm really enjoying having my own space; I've got a bunk bed, home theature system, full PC setup, and a desk for homework. The cafeteria food won't be good until school starts but it's alright nonetheless. I'm a tutor for an early start intensive Biology class and I'm really excited to help introduce students to Thomas and also create content.</p>
            <p>I've been here for about a week now, and it's time for me to start with some new habits. I moved to college for an opportunity to start fresh, so now I need to act on that. I've got a lot of goals for this year, and I'm excited to see how they play out.</p>
