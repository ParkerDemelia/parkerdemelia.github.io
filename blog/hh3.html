            <P> My internship has just ended. It was an incredible experience that I have taken so much from. I’ve spent the last few nights after work not doing a whole lot, leading to sluggish mornings full of regret. I’ve got this idea that things have to be perfect for them to play out, so if I don’t win the morning the rest of the day is messed up and since I didn’t win the morning I might as well not workout and since I didnt workout I might as well not take a cold shower and do my nighttime routine and since I didn’t do any of that I might as well not go to bed early and then here we are. </P>
            <P> You can see how the slope is slippery af. I had a really good week a bit ago where I went on a bunch of day trips with a friend, and that was the best I’ve ever felt. Things were in my control and I really thought I was on top of the world. But then little things come up like injuries and bad weather and work and staying out too late and suddenly things take a turn for the worse. And here we are, feeling like I don’t have it under control. </P>
            <P> It’s Friday, July 12th, I’m out at lunch after finishing my last day at work. I feel like I ended strong and am on to new things. </P>
            <P> It’s Sunday, July 14th, I just got back from a great day out on the beach and a friends. This is what life was meant to be. I feel happy, content, fufilled, and I’m surrounded by great friends and family who want to see me succeed. </P>
            <P> After a long day, I really need some quality sleep before I jump back into it. I plan to have a great week, filled with exercise, running, lots of tanning, and so much more. </P>

            Goals for the week:
            <ul>
                <li>Lift every day</li>
                <li>Run 10 miles</li>
                <li>Create 1 video</li>
                <li>Write 1 blog post</li>
                <li>Finish 2 books</li>
                <li>Meditate and journal every day</li>
                <li>Earn money</li>
            </ul>
