            <h1>Habitat Highlights #5</h1>
            <div class="blog-meta">January 11th, 2025</div>
            <p> It's been a while since my last post. I'd label these last few months as "overcommitting and underperforming" and the lesson is that I need to follow through on the promises I make to myself and others. I think the first one was that I ended my internship slightly premature to go back down south, which I never ended up doing. Then, I got hired as a videographer at Thomas where I made some big plans and never followed through. Lately, it's been about my personal entraprueral ventures and how I tell people I'm starting x business but never follow through. </p>
            <p> All that to say I've aimed high, talked higher, but shot too low and fell short. On one hand, I'm really disapointed in myself. I know I'm capable of doing these things and I feel like I've let a lot of folks down. Further, I feel like I've greatly reduced my trust in myself. I also live with a tinge of regret, knowing that I could have just actually done the things I said I would and I would be so much better off.     
            <p> Anyway, here's what's actually going on in my life.  I picked up some shifts this week, which really helped me get up early and just get used to having responsibilities. I've been to the gym a few times, but have surgery soon so have been taking lower-body work pretty light. Spent thanksgiving seeing family in New Jersey and spent a week of December in Myrtle Beach visiting my grandparents. With the help of AI, I've built this site as a way to move away from the bloated free-tier of wordpress. I attended church for the first time alone this past sunday and I think it marks the start of a great path forwards. </p>
            <p> As for my life at school, it's been interesting, to say the least. I've never been a fan of school to be honest. I've always tended to pick up on things very quickly, so much so that classes are just repetitive and boring. Further, the workload I was given at Thomas (which is already condensed from 3 years to 2) is still fairly light. I found myself multiple weeks ahead of schedule in some of my classes, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but doesn't make me feel like it was worth my time in the first place. I made a lot of great friends this past semester; we took a roadtrip to vermont, partied a bit, and hit the gym just as much. If I learned anything this semester, it's the value of having people around who you can let loose and have a good time with. </p>
            <p> Just before I left for break, I started on a clothing brand which I had intended to launch on January 1st. The whole premise of the brand was that it stood for new beginnings, and the 1st would be a great way to drop the new brand. With that said, I certainly knew that I wouldn't have been able to develop an entire clothing brand in one month, so I took a bit of an unconcious step backwards from that. As the shopify bill drafted a few days ago, I decided it would be good to pick it back up. I'll reveal more later, but for now, <a href="https://infit.site/" target="_blank">infit.site</a> is where you can find the brand. </p>
            <p> While in Myrtle Beach, my sister was accepted into Duke University. I'm really excited for her and I'm sure she'll do great. With that said, It's inspired me to set my sights high, or atleat as high as fleeing the nest I call home. Since I'll be out of school in May, It just makes sense that I make some big changes to my life. As reflected above, I'll just leave it at that to not make promises to others I don't keep. For myself though, I've got some great ideas, which have been great to mentally entertain, but are leading to me feeling a bit lost as I really don't know where exactly to go. </p>
            <p> I'm excited for what the future brings. </p><br>
