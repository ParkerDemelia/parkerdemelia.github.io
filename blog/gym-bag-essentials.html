            <p>My name is Parker Demelia, and I chose to write about this because I go to the gym a lot. At one point or another, I’ve had to make these decisions, and have tried out each of the following items in the gym.</p>
            
            <p>I’ve found most of these to be effective at improving my experience at the gym, but that’s not to say that all of this gear will work for everyone because it probably won’t. It’s up to you to deem it useful or not. Some may be more practical for you, and some less. It all depends on your goals and experience level.</p>
            
            <p>Speaking of goals, the new year is a great time to snag a cheap gym membership. If you plan to use a public gym, you’ll need to sign up for a gym membership, usually at the facility in which you will be using. This normally includes visiting the gym (with a parent if you are a minor) and filling out some paperwork. This paperwork is there so they can register who you are, get you an account in their system, and start a payment plan for you. The gyms in my area range from $10 per month up to $35 per month, but it all depends on age, time of year, etc. You’ll also have to make sure that you are educated on their plans because some gyms (like Planet Fitness) have a 12-month minimum signup and annual fees on top of their monthly rate. If you plan to work out that day, however, you will probably want a few more things before you get started.</p>
            
            <p>Now, because you’re in a public gym, you’ll need to appeal to their dress code. You’ll generally want to choose an outfit that allows for a wide range of motion that also won’t trap in too much body heat ****and covers what it needs to. I usually opt for a tank top and some lightweight shorts. I found comfortable tank tops from Target and cheap shorts from Tj-Maxx. Most gyms also have a close-toed shoe policy, so having a nice pair of shoes with great foot support will benefit you in the long run. I tend to wear my Nike Blazers to work out. During the snow/salt season, some gyms recommend that you bring an extra pair of shoes to change into while working out to keep the floors clean.</p>
            <p>Completing a workout will probably cause you to sweat, so you’ll want to bring a full water bottle to stay hydrated. In that bottle, you can add various substances to improve your experience like electrolyte powder to replenish electrolytes, flavored drink packets for taste, pre-workout to help enhance focus, or creatine to enhance muscle energy. Personally, I use 5g of creatine when I workout and stay away from pre-workout. If you plan on being there for a while, a small snack like a protein bar or fruit may not be a bad idea to bring as well. You might not want to consume a big meal right before hitting the gym because you’ll be moving a lot, and having a full stomach while running around isn’t fun.</p>
            <p>Since you will have been sweating for a few hours, you might want to shower. Most gyms have locker rooms equipped with sinks and showers for you to freshen up. You should probably bring a duffle bag with clean clothes, a towel, toiletries, and any other items that you may need to clean up after a long workout. This can also double as a place to store your gym clothes, shoes, and other workout equipment when you leave.</p>
            <p>If you plan to work out often, you’ll probably want to track what exercises you do and your progress up to that point. I recommend ordering a journal from Amazon that can double as a place to write about your life. A simple notebook lying around the house would also suffice. Based on my experience, leaving my phone in my bag allows me to focus wholly on my workout. This allows me to focus on my workout instead of giving my attention to the apps and notifications on my phone. However, if you would rather stick to your phone, there are tons of apps that allow you to track workout progress like Strava and Nike Fitness. Myfitnesspal is a food-tracking app that also allows you to record workouts.  If you decide to bring your phone and also want to listen to music, you may want to get a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or over-the-ear headphones so everyone doesn’t have to listen to your music.</p>
            <p>Now you have a place to record, but you don’t know what to record. This is where finding a workout plan is essential. You can see mine here. Depending on your fitness goals, there are tons of different workouts that will be beneficial for you. If you are looking to improve running times or speeds, you will mainly want to point your focus toward treadmill workouts. This can include speed runs, intervals, incline runs, tempo runs, etc. If your main goal is to build strength, you’ll want to use the weights and machines in combination with progressive overload. This involves tons of different exercises using dumbbells, barbells, cables, and other machines to increase the amount of weight and/or repetitions that you can do. Also using these exercises, you can build muscular endurance by using lower weights but higher repetitions. I’ll go into more detail about specific workouts here.</p>
            <p>As I stated in the beginning, this collection might not be for everyone. Casual gym-goers probably don’t need all of this nitty gritty stuff to get an effective workout in, and for others, this may be exactly what they need. You may not use all of these items, but some are a necessity, and others may just be convenient to have. Regardless, It’s good to have a list of items to refer to if you decide to start working out. Now you’ve got a head start on the best journey of your life.</p>
