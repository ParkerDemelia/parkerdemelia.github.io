            <p> I sit in a cafe writing this update. The first of it’s kind. Something that I promised over a month ago, but got pushed to the wayside to be replaced by scrolling on instagram and facebook marketplace. </p>
            <p> I’ve hit a little bit of a rut. In an effort to buy myself more freetime and accelerate school, spending a semester online caused me to live the life of a hermit. I didn’t get out as much as I would have liked, often procrastinating my schoolwork til later in the week, leaving me doing assignments just hours before they were due. </p>
            <p> Anyway, here I am… All done with my first year at Thomas College and my third year credit wise. I don’t think I mind that I’ll be done sooner rather than later. It’s a weird feeling, because I don’t really know what to do after I’m done, but it feels right. </p>
            <p> With a degree in Computer Science, I’d like to travel the world while working remotely, funding the bulk of my travels. In an ideal world, this tech job would be replaced by creating content for others to watch and be inspired by. </p>
            <p> I need to pick up content creation again. I know when I do everything else will follow. I’d like to restart the podcast, maybe establish a set in my garage to work from, and just starting with my friends. I’d like to start vlogging again, from rise to rest, creating stories from even the most mundaine things. </p>
            <p> I started up a summer internship a few weeks ago. It’s been pretty good, giving me incredible field experience in an IT postion. I’ve got some family trips planned for the summer, going to Orlando in just a few weeks and Jersey for Independence Day. I’d love to attend some concerts. </p>
            <p> Overall, I’m doing well. Looking forward for what lies ahead while trying to focus on what going on in the now. </p>
