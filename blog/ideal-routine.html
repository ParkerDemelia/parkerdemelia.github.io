            <h1>Finding My Ideal Routine</h1>
            <div class="blog-meta">January 1, 2024</div>

            <p>If schedules are your thing, you should find one that works for you and stick to it. For me, a schedule helps me stay consistently productive day in and out. In an attempt to stay positive, I’ve created an Ideal daily schedule that can be downloaded below. It features an hour-by-hour playthrough as well as specific activities that can be implemented to live a positive life.“Beep…beep….beep….BEEP”</p>
            <p>My alarm goes off at 5:20 AM. I drink a glass of water and make my bed before doing anything else. No phone to be seen for the first hour of my day. I’ll take 10 minutes to myself, meditating, journaling, or just mapping out my day just to gain control of my thoughts.</p>
            <p>At around 5:30 I’m ready to start my day. This involves putting on a tank top and shorts and heading to the kitchen. I’ll make a small breakfast, usually, a breakfast sandwich and a banana, fill my water bottle (5g creatine ofc), and pack my lunch (if I have school.)</p>
            <p>I’ll make sure my gym bag has all of the essentials  that will help me get through my workout, and I’ll head to the gym. My workouts typically last for about an hour and a half, you can check out my workout split here. I’ll record my workout in a journal, I recommend this one. I find that it helps me stay present during my workout instead of using my phone.</p>
            <p>The gym that I go to is the YMCA and is only about 20 minutes away. Out of the local gyms, it is the best-priced and has a very nice locker room. After my workout, I’ll hop into the steam room for about 10 minutes where I can meditate and relax after my workout. I’ll then take a cold shower to freshen up for the day. Included in my gym bag are a towel, clean clothes, toiletries, and the shoes that I will wear that day.</p>
            <p>Depending on whether it’s a school day or not, I’ll either head to school and start working or go home and make a meal. Ideally, I would go home and make my high cal quesadilla to boost me toward my calorie goal for the day. While cooking and driving, I’ll usually listen to a podcast by Andrew Huberman or Chris Williamson. I think it’s important to take some time to breathe, so I take my breakfast as a time to relax and enjoy my food, not looking at a device or thinking about what’s going on in the day.</p>
            <p>Ideally, after I eat breakfast I would begin working. This may be writing in my blog, doing school work, recording and/or editing, or a combination of many other things. If it were to be summertime, I would do this outside absorbing sunlight and fresh air. If not, I would be at my desk with minimal distractions around me.</p>
            <p>From here, the rest of the day is open for the most part. It should involve eating lunch, some creative work, and then leisure time. Dinner should ideally be a few hours before bed, and then a night routine should be followed to get ready for bed and the next day.</p>
