            <p>Settling into school pretty nicely. I feel it&#039;s going to go really well this semester. My workload doesn&#039;t seem to be too bad and I&#039;ll have plenty of time to work on myself, my brand, and my future. Besides, these classes seem like they&#039;ll be fun things to learn, namely, Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing. My room at school is pretty similar to last semester, including me leaving the windows open just as much. I just love the fresh air, and you couldn&#039;t get me away from opening a window, even in winter, to cycle some air in.</p>

<p>I had surgery a week and a half ago. I was very worried leading up to the surgery how long it would take me to recover, but within 3-4 days I was able to go to the gym and perform some light exercise, and now I feel pretty normal. I&#039;ll give it some more time before I perform heavy lifts but I plan on staying consistant with staying active, because in my mind that&#039;s the best way to recover.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t really have much else to write about. There isn&#039;t much new about my life. I plan on lifting later today, recording a life update, and that&#039;s really about it. I&#039;ll do more of the same tomorrow, with the addition of church, and maybe finding a bible, but other than that, we live on.</p>
