            <h1>Habitat Highlights #2</h1>
            <div class="blog-meta">June 17th, 2024</div>

            <p> Finished up with school over a month ago. It feels great to have a light workload; just two summer classes and my internship which I’ll be done with soon. ‘I finally have time to‘ – I just wrote this down, lit a candle, and then looked back to realize this mindset is completly wrong. I havn’t had my time priorities in the right place. If I had, my work would be done when it was assigned, I’d be off of my phone, and out into the world. </p>

            <p> I took a trip into Baxter State Park with some guys this week. We set out to hike Katadahin, the tallest mountain in Maine, about a 4 hour drive from where we live. We got our reservation booked, stuff packed, and headed off to stay in the mountains for a few days. </p>

            <p> As we summited up, our moral was high, pushing pash brush, up rocks, and into the clouds to get to our destination. Hitting Pamola Peak was great, we stopped, took some photos, and then looked toward what lied ahead. It looked daunting to climb the ridge from Pamala down over to Baxter Peak, but we were ready for the challange. </p>

            <p> Then came the rain. </p>

            <p> It stopped us dead in our tracks, unsure of what to do next. If we kept going, we could risk our lives trying to summit. Was it worth it? We wern’t too sure. If we turned back, our pledge to hike Katahdin would be over and done with. Being able to say we hiked this mountain would be such an achievement. With clouds pouring rain on top of us, and no outlook as to when it would stop, we decided to hike back down the mountain. </p>

            <p> It was a silent car ride home, to say the least. But we had left it all on that mountain, and had to accept that hiking to Baxter Peak (or the lack thereof) was out of our control. If you think about it, that’s really all life is; a game of control. </p>
