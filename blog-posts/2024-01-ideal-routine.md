# Finding My Ideal Routine

After years of experimenting with different schedules and habits, I've found a routine that works perfectly for my creative work and personal well-being. Here's what it looks like:

## Morning
- 5:30 AM: Wake up naturally (no alarm)
- 6:00 AM: Light workout or yoga
- 6:30 AM: Cold shower and meditation
- 7:00 AM: Creative work (no distractions)

## Mid-Day
- 12:00 PM: Light lunch
- 1:00 PM: Focused work sessions
- 3:00 PM: Nature walk or outdoor break

## Evening
- 6:00 PM: Dinner and family time
- 7:30 PM: Reading or learning
- 9:00 PM: Wind down, no screens
- 9:30 PM: Sleep

## Key Principles
1. Prioritize sleep quality
2. Start with creative work
3. Regular movement throughout the day
4. Minimize digital distractions
5. Make time for nature

This routine isn't rigid - it's more of a framework that I adapt based on the day's needs. The most important aspect is maintaining the core habits that support my creative work and mental clarity.
