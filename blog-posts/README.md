# Blog Posts

This directory contains blog post content. Each post should be in its own markdown file.

## Structure
- Use markdown (.md) files for posts
- Include a date in the filename (e.g., `2024-01-01-post-title.md`)
- Add images in a separate `images` subfolder if needed

## Example Post Format
```markdown
---
title: Post Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: Brief description of the post
